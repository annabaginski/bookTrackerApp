# Add it to the TBR Book Tracker

A tracking app where users can add what they are currently reading (book title and author); mark them as completed, and delete them.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB, Bootstrap


## Optimizations

I have a number of ideas to add to this application when revisit it, some of which include: user profiles and sign-in, different list categories (ex. to be read list, read list, etc.), counters for books read that can be filtered by time, and an option to leave a review after completion. 

## Lessons Learned:

As this was my first application incorporating CRUD and a database on my own and writing the code from scratch, there were many lessons learned most of which revolve around using the right property name to access each document in the database (oh and to check the whitelisted IP address of your database ESPECIALLY when you have internet issues and have to get a new router - it was a rude awakening when I couldn't connect my database and then thought to check the network access in MongoDB).
